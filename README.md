# Daily-Planner App

## Description
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the working day (assuming they work a 9am-5pm schedule). The app will save tasks for the entire day and then get rid of the tasks the following day. The date at the top of the app automatically updates daily while linked to moment.js. The app itself tracks by the hour using moment.js.
